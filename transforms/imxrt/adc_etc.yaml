# Boolean enum transforms for ADC_ETC peripheral
# Converts single-bit enums with _0/_1 patterns to proper boolean types

transforms:
  # Delete misc control enums
  - !DeleteEnums
    from: adc_etc::vals::(DmaModeSel|Softrst)
    bit_size: 1

  # Delete trigger chain enums (Trig0-3 have all patterns, Trig4-7 only have some)
  - !DeleteEnums
    from: adc_etc::vals::Trig[0-3](Chain\d+B2b\d+|Chain\d+Ie\dEn|Ctrl(SwTrig|SyncMode|TrigMode)|Done\d+|Enable|Err|Req)

  # Delete trigger enums for Trig4-7 (limited patterns)
  - !DeleteEnums
